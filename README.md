# Bamazon

## Overview

In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The app may also track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
